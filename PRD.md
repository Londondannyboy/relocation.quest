# Relocation Quest V3 - Product Requirements Document

> This is the **north star document**. All development decisions reference this PRD.

## Vision

An AI-powered relocation advisor (ATLAS) that helps people explore international destinations through conversational chat and voice, providing real data on visas, costs, taxes, and lifestyle factors.

## Problem Statement

People considering international relocation face information overload. Visa requirements, cost of living, tax implications, and lifestyle factors are scattered across government sites, expat forums, and outdated blog posts. There's no single source that:
- Provides structured, comparable data across destinations
- Answers follow-up questions conversationally
- Remembers user preferences and context
- Works via both text and voice

## Target Users

| User Type | Description | Primary Need |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Digital Nomads | Remote workers seeking tax-friendly, visa-friendly destinations | Visa options, internet quality, cost of living |
| Expats/Retirees | People planning permanent international moves | Residency paths, healthcare, tax implications |
| Tax-Conscious Professionals | High earners exploring legal tax optimization | Corporate tax rates, NHR/Beckham Law programs |

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript | SSR, App Router, modern React |
| UI Framework | Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion | Rapid styling, smooth animations |
| AI Chat | CopilotKit + Gemini adapter | Structured tool calls, generative UI |
| Agent | Pydantic AI (Phase 2) | Type-safe tools, AG-UI protocol |
| Database | Neon PostgreSQL | Serverless, branching, auth built-in |
| Voice | Hume EVI (Phase 2) | Low-latency emotional voice AI |
| Memory | Zep Cloud (Phase 2) | Conversation memory, user facts |
| Auth | Neon Auth (@neondatabase/auth) | Integrated with database |

### Key Integration Points

1. **Frontend ↔ Agent**: Currently CopilotKit Next.js runtime; target is AG-UI protocol to Railway
2. **Agent ↔ Database**: Direct PostgreSQL queries via asyncpg
3. **Voice ↔ Agent**: CLM endpoint (OpenAI-compatible SSE streaming)
4. **Memory ↔ Agent**: Zep Cloud for conversation history and user facts

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Destinations covered | 20+ | 17 | Count in database |
| Articles published | 50+ | 53 ✓ | Count in database |
| SEO: External links | 100% | 100% ✓ | Audit script |
| SEO: Internal links | 100% | 100% ✓ | Audit script |
| Query response time | <3s | TBD | Measure API latency |
| Voice response latency | <1s | TBD | Hume dashboard metrics |
| User return rate | 30%+ | TBD | Auth + analytics |

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Railway cold starts | Medium | Medium | Keep-alive pings, optimize startup |
| Hume SSE format issues | Medium | High | Thorough CLM testing, fallback to chat |
| Destination data staleness | High | Medium | Regular data updates, source citations |
| Voice misunderstanding queries | Medium | Medium | Robust entity extraction, confirmation UI |

## Open Questions

- [x] Use CopilotKit built-in runtime or separate agent? → Target: separate agent
- [ ] How to handle destinations not in database? → Fallback to web search?
- [ ] Should voice and chat share exact same prompt? → Yes (Single Brain principle)
- [ ] How to cite sources for visa/tax information? → TBD
