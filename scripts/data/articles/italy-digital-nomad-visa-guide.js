  introduction: `<strong><strong>Italy</strong></strong> has finally joined the digital nomad visa movement, offering remote workers the chance to legally experience la dolce vita. From Rome's ancient grandeur to Florence's Renaissance treasures, from Milan's fashion and finance to the Amalfi Coast's beauty, Italy delivers unmatched art, history, food, and lifestyle. The new Digital Nomad Visa provides a pathway for non-EU remote workers, while the country's position in the heart of Europe makes exploring the continent easy. Yes, Italian bureaucracy is legendary, and costs in major cities rival other Western European capitals, but for those seeking beauty, culture, and cuisine, Italy remains irresistible.`,
