This guide covers everything you need to know about Cyprus visit visa requirements in 2026, including who needs a visa, required documents, application process, and what to expect at the border.`,

    {
      question: 'Do I need a visa to visit Cyprus from the USA?',
      answer: 'No. US citizens can visit Cyprus visa-free for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. You need a valid passport, return ticket, and proof of accommodation/funds. No advance registration required, though ETIAS may apply in future for EU entry generally (but Cyprus is not Schengen).'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use a Schengen visa to enter Cyprus?',
      answer: 'No. Cyprus is an EU member but NOT part of the Schengen Area. Schengen visas are not valid for Cyprus entry, and Cyprus visas don\'t allow Schengen travel. You need separate visas if your nationality requires them for both areas.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long can I stay in Cyprus as a tourist?',
      answer: 'Most visa-exempt nationalities can stay up to 90 days in any 180-day period. EU citizens have unlimited stay rights. If you need a visa, duration is specified on your visa (usually up to 90 days for tourist visa).'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does a Cyprus tourist visa cost?',
      answer: 'Cyprus visa fees are €20 for single-entry and €60 for multiple-entry visas—lower than Schengen fees (€80). Some nationalities may have different fees due to bilateral agreements. Additional service center fees may apply.'

    {
      question: 'How long does Cyprus visa processing take?',
      answer: 'Standard processing is 7-15 working days. Apply at least 3-4 weeks before travel to allow for any delays. Processing may be longer during peak tourist season (summer months).'

      answer: 'Required: valid passport (6+ months validity), application form, photos, flight itinerary, accommodation proof, travel insurance (€30,000 medical coverage), bank statements, employment letter, and any purpose-specific documents (business invitation, family host letter, etc.).'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I enter Cyprus through North Cyprus?',
      answer: 'If you enter through ports or airports in the Turkish-controlled north (Ercan airport, Kyrenia port), the Republic of Cyprus doesn\'t recognize this entry. You won\'t be able to cross to the south. Enter through Larnaca or Paphos airports (Republic) to access all of Cyprus.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Does time in Cyprus count toward Schengen 90/180 days?',
      answer: 'No. Since Cyprus is not part of the Schengen Area, time spent in Cyprus is completely separate from your Schengen allowance. You could spend 90 days in Cyprus and still have your full 90 days available for Schengen countries.'
