The visa offers up to 3 years of residency for those working remotely for non-Cyprus employers or clients, with a standout benefit: 0% income tax on remote work earnings for the first two years. Combined with English as a widely spoken language, EU membership, excellent beaches, and a growing expat community, Cyprus has become one of Europe's most attractive digital nomad destinations.`,

<h2 id="application-process">Application Process</h2>

<h3>Step 2: Secure Accommodation</h3>

<h3>Step 3: Submit Application</h3>
<p>Apply through one of these channels:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Online:</strong> Cyprus government online portal (recommended)</li>
  <li><strong>In-person:</strong> Civil Registry and Migration Department in Cyprus (if already legally in Cyprus)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Step 4: Pay Fees</h3>
<p>Application fee is approximately €70. Additional fees may apply for document processing.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Processing (4-8 weeks)</h3>
<p>Wait for application review. You may be contacted for additional documents or clarification.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Receive Approval</h3>
<p>Upon approval, receive your residence permit. If applying from abroad, you'll receive approval to travel; final permit issued upon arrival and registration.</p>

<h3>Step 7: Register in Cyprus</h3>
<p>Upon arrival, register with local authorities and collect your residence permit card.</p>

<h2 id="tax-benefits">Tax Benefits Explained</h2>

<p>Cyprus offers exceptional tax treatment for digital nomads:</p>

<h3>0% Tax on DN Visa Income (First 2 Years)</h3>
<p>Income earned while on the Digital Nomad Visa from remote work for non-Cyprus entities is exempt from Cyprus income tax for the first two years. This is a significant benefit compared to most other DN visas.</p>

<h3>After 2 Years</h3>
<p>If you continue on the DN visa beyond 2 years, or transition to another residence permit, Cyprus tax rates apply. However, Cyprus has generally favorable tax treatment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No tax on dividends for individuals</li>
  <li>No tax on interest income</li>
  <li>No wealth tax or inheritance tax</li>
  <li>Flat 12.5% corporate tax (lowest in EU)</li>
  <li>Special regimes for high earners (50% exemption for new residents)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important Caveats</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tax residency rules still apply—spending 183+ days triggers residency</li>
  <li>Home country tax obligations may continue (especially for US citizens)</li>
  <li>Consult a tax professional for your specific situation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cost-of-living">Cost of Living</h2>

<p>Cyprus is mid-range for the Mediterranean—cheaper than France or Italy, comparable to Greece, more expensive than Portugal:</p>
