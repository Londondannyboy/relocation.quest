  introduction: `<strong><strong>Australia</strong></strong> consistently ranks among the world's most desirable destinations for expats, offering an unbeatable combination of economic opportunity, lifestyle, and natural beauty. From Sydney's iconic harbor to Melbourne's laneway culture, from the Great Barrier Reef to the Outback, Australia delivers diverse experiences. The country's points-based immigration system actively seeks skilled workers, with clear pathways to permanent residence and citizenship. While the cost of living (especially housing) is high, Australian salaries are among the world's best. For those seeking sunshine, outdoor living, and a fresh start in an English-speaking country, Australia remains the gold standard.`,
