  introduction: `<strong><strong>Austria</strong></strong> offers a compelling mix of imperial grandeur, Alpine beauty, exceptional quality of life, and central European location. Vienna consistently tops global livability rankings, while cities like Salzburg and Innsbruck provide mountain access with urban amenities. While Austria doesn't have a dedicated "digital nomad visa," several pathways exist for remote workers, including the Red-White-Red Card for skilled workers and self-employment options. Austria's high standards come with higher costs and notorious bureaucracy, but for those who navigate it, the reward is life in one of Europe's most beautiful and cultured countries.`,

      question: 'Does Austria have a digital nomad visa?',
      answer: 'No, Austria does not have a specific digital nomad visa. Non-EU remote workers can stay 90 days on tourist status (Schengen). Longer stays require other pathways like the self-employment residence permit (difficult) or finding Austrian employment for a Red-White-Red Card.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I work remotely in Austria on a tourist visa?',
      answer: 'Technically no—tourist status doesn\'t permit work, and Austria interprets this strictly. Working remotely for foreign clients while on tourist status is a gray area and officially not allowed. For legal long-term remote work, you need a proper residence permit.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How expensive is Vienna?',
      answer: 'Budget €1,800-2,500/month for comfortable living. A central 1BR apartment costs €1,000-1,400. Vienna\'s exceptional public transit (€365/year pass) helps keep costs down. It\'s expensive by European standards but offers exceptional quality of life.'

    },
    {
      question: 'What is the best city for expats in Austria?',
      answer: 'Vienna has the largest international community, most job opportunities, and best English proficiency. Salzburg and Innsbruck offer Alpine access with smaller-town feel. Graz is more affordable and less touristy. Choice depends on priorities: career (Vienna), mountains (Innsbruck), culture (Salzburg).'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Austrian bureaucracy really that difficult?',
      answer: 'Yes, Austria is known for extensive bureaucracy. Expect multiple appointments, long waits, many forms, and German language requirements. Registration (Meldezettel) is mandatory within 3 days of arrival. Patience and thorough documentation are essential.'
