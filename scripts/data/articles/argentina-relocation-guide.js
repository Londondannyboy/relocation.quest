  introduction: `<strong><strong>Argentina</strong></strong> captivates with its European-influenced culture, passionate people, world-class beef and wine, and dramatic landscapes from Buenos Aires' grand avenues to Patagonia's glaciers. The country offers exceptional value for those earning in foreign currency—a phenomenon that has attracted waves of digital nomads and remote workers. Buenos Aires is a cosmopolitan city rivaling European capitals at a fraction of the cost. Argentina launched a Digital Nomad Visa in 2022, though its tourist-friendly visa policy means many stay on 90-day renewals. This guide covers everything you need to know about relocating to Argentina in 2026.`,
