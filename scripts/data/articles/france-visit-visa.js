  introduction: `<strong><strong>France</strong></strong>—home to the Eiffel Tower, world-class wine, Mediterranean beaches, Alpine skiing, and unparalleled culture—remains the world's most visited country. Whether you're dreaming of Parisian cafés, Provence lavender fields, or the French Riviera, understanding visa requirements is essential for non-EU visitors. France is part of the Schengen Area, meaning a French Schengen visa grants access to 26 European countries. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to successfully apply for a French tourist visa in 2026.`,
