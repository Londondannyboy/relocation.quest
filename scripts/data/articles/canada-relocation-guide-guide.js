  ],

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How do I immigrate to Canada through Express Entry?',
      answer: 'Express Entry is a points-based system (CRS score). Create a profile, get scored on age, education, work experience, language skills, and job offers. If invited (CRS cutoff varies, typically 450-500+), apply for permanent residence. Provincial Nominee Programs can add 600 points, boosting your chances significantly.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What CRS score do I need for Express Entry?',
      answer: 'CRS cutoff scores vary by draw, typically ranging from 450-500+. Scores depend on pool competitiveness. Provincial nomination adds 600 points, essentially guaranteeing invitation. In 2024, category-based draws target specific occupations (healthcare, tech, trades) with varying cutoffs.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How expensive is Toronto?',
      answer: 'Very expensive. Budget CAD $3,000-4,500/month. A downtown 1BR apartment costs CAD $2,300-2,800. Housing is the biggest cost driver. Montreal and Calgary are 20-30% cheaper while still offering strong job markets.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Canadian healthcare work?',
      answer: 'Each province runs its own public healthcare plan (OHIP in Ontario, MSP in BC, etc.). Doctor visits and hospital care are free for residents. New residents typically wait 3 months for coverage—private insurance essential during this period. Prescriptions, dental, and vision require private insurance.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I work while waiting for permanent residence?',
      answer: 'You need a work permit to work in Canada before PR. Options include employer-sponsored LMIA permits, intra-company transfers, post-graduation work permits, or open work permits for spouses of skilled workers. Some Express Entry candidates can get bridging work permits.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the Provincial Nominee Program?',
      answer: 'PNPs allow provinces to nominate candidates for permanent residence. Each province has different streams (tech, skilled workers, entrepreneurs). PNP nomination adds 600 points to Express Entry score, essentially guaranteeing invitation. BC Tech Pilot and Ontario Tech Draws are popular tech pathways.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long until I can become a Canadian citizen?',
      answer: 'After becoming a permanent resident, you must live in Canada for 3 out of 5 years to be eligible for citizenship. You must also pass a citizenship test, meet language requirements (English or French), and file taxes. Canadian citizenship offers visa-free travel to 180+ countries.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Montreal a good option if I don\'t speak French?',
      answer: 'Many businesses operate in English, especially in tech. However, French is primary language and essential for full integration, some jobs, and government services. Quebec has separate immigration system with French requirements. Montreal offers excellent value and culture if you are willing to learn French.'
