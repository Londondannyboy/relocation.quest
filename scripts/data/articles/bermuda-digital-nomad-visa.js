      answer: 'The Work From Bermuda certificate requires: employment by company outside Bermuda or self-employment with foreign clients, valid health insurance for Bermuda, clean criminal record, and completed online application with $263 fee ($525 for families). There\'s no minimum income requirement stated, but you must demonstrate financial stability. Processing takes 5-7 business days.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How expensive is it to live in Bermuda?',
      answer: 'Bermuda is one of the world\'s most expensive places. Budget minimum is $3,500-4,500/month. Comfortable living costs $5,500-8,000/month. Rent alone for a basic 1BR apartment starts around $2,000-2,500/month. Groceries and dining are 2-3x US prices. Plan for premium costs in all categories. This is not a budget destination.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I pay taxes in Bermuda as a digital nomad?',
      answer: 'Bermuda has no income tax, no capital gains tax, and no withholding tax on foreign earnings. As a remote worker on the Work From Bermuda certificate earning from foreign sources, you pay zero Bermuda tax. However, US citizens still owe US tax on worldwide income. Other nationalities should check their home country tax residency rules.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I rent a car in Bermuda?',
      answer: 'No—visitors cannot rent cars in Bermuda. Only residents with Bermudian licenses can drive cars. Visitors must use scooters/mopeds (available for rent), e-bikes, buses, ferries, or taxis. This is intentional to manage traffic on the small island. Getting comfortable with scooter riding is essentially mandatory for independence.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How is the internet for remote work in Bermuda?',
      answer: 'Internet in Bermuda is good, with speeds of 50-200 Mbps available through providers like One Communications and Digicel. Reliability is generally excellent. Home internet costs $100-200/month. Mobile 4G coverage is good island-wide. For a small island, connectivity infrastructure is solid and suitable for remote work.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the best time to visit Bermuda?',
      answer: 'April-June and September-November offer the best balance of weather, prices, and fewer crowds. Summer (June-September) is warmest but also hurricane season with higher humidity. Winter (December-February) is cooler (15-20°C) but still mild. Hurricane season officially runs June-November, with September-October being highest risk.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Bermuda safe?',
      answer: 'Bermuda is extremely safe with very low crime rates. It\'s one of the safest places in the world. There\'s no dangerous wildlife or natural predators. Main risks are scooter accidents (drive carefully, wear helmet) and hurricane preparedness during storm season. The biggest adjustment is learning to ride a scooter safely on left-side roads.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How far is Bermuda from the US?',
      answer: 'Bermuda is approximately 650 miles east of North Carolina, about a 2-hour flight from New York, Boston, or other East Coast cities. It\'s in the Atlantic Time Zone (1 hour ahead of EST). This proximity and time zone alignment make it ideal for remote workers with US-based clients or employers who want Caribbean-style island life with easy access home.'
