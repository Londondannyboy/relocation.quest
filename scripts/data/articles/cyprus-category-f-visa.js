  introduction: `<strong><strong>Cyprus</strong></strong> Category F permanent residence is one of Europe's most attractive residency-by-investment programs, offering fast-track permanent residency in an EU member state for a relatively modest €300,000 investment. Unlike temporary visas, Category F grants permanent residence from day one—no waiting period, no renewals needed. The program appeals to investors, retirees, and high-net-worth individuals seeking EU access, favorable tax treatment, and Mediterranean lifestyle. Processing takes just 2-3 months, making it one of the fastest PR programs in Europe.`,
