  introduction: `<strong>New</strong> Zealand offers something truly unique: a first-world lifestyle in one of the world's most stunning natural environments. From the fjords of Milford Sound to the geothermal wonders of Rotorua, from Middle Earth filming locations to world-class wine regions, NZ delivers extraordinary quality of life. The country consistently ranks among the top nations for safety, low corruption, and life satisfaction. While the distance from Europe and North America is significant, many find the trade-off worthwhile. New Zealand's points-based immigration system prioritizes skilled workers, and the pathway to permanent residence is clear and achievable for qualified candidates.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'How do I immigrate to New Zealand?',
      answer: 'The main pathway is the Skilled Migrant Category, a points-based system requiring 160+ points from factors like age (under 55), qualifications, work experience, and job offers. Green List occupations (doctors, engineers, IT professionals) get fast-track processing. Work to Residence via Accredited Employer Work Visa is another option—work 2 years then apply for residence.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does it cost to live in Auckland?',
      answer: 'Budget NZ$3,500-5,000/month ($2,100-3,000) for comfortable living. A 1BR apartment in central Auckland costs NZ$2,000-2,800/month. Groceries run NZ$400-600/month. Auckland is expensive but offers the most job opportunities. Wellington and Christchurch are 15-20% cheaper.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is there a digital nomad visa for New Zealand?',
      answer: 'No, New Zealand doesn\'t have a dedicated digital nomad visa. Options include: Visitor visa (3-6 months, technically no work), Working Holiday visa (18-30/35 years old, 12+ months), or pursuing work visas if you have in-demand skills. Some remote workers visit on tourist visas, but this is a legal gray area.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What jobs are in demand in New Zealand?',
      answer: 'The Green List highlights shortage occupations: doctors, nurses, engineers (all types), software developers/engineers, construction professionals, teachers in STEM subjects, and various healthcare roles. These occupations get faster visa processing and often straight-to-residence pathways.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is New Zealand worth moving to?',
      answer: 'For the right person, yes. New Zealand offers exceptional quality of life, safety, natural beauty, and work-life balance. Trade-offs include: geographic isolation (24+ hours to Europe), lower salaries than US/UK, expensive housing, and limited product variety. It\'s ideal for those prioritizing lifestyle over career advancement or proximity to family.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Auckland vs Wellington: which is better?',
      answer: 'Auckland has more jobs, better infrastructure, and international connections but is expensive with traffic issues. Wellington is more compact, walkable, with a strong arts/cafe scene but is famously windy and has a smaller job market. Auckland suits corporate careers; Wellington suits government, tech, and creative industries.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How is healthcare in New Zealand?',
      answer: 'New Zealand has a public healthcare system funded by taxes. GPs charge fees (~NZ$50-70 per visit) but hospital care is free. ACC (Accident Compensation Corporation) covers all accident injuries—a world-unique system. Many residents have private insurance for faster specialist access and dental care.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I bring my family to New Zealand?',
      answer: 'Yes. Partners of work visa holders can usually get open work visas. Children can attend public school for free if a parent is on a qualifying visa. Family inclusion is factored into residence applications—partner qualifications can add points to your Skilled Migrant application.'
