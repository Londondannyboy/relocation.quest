  introduction: `<strong><strong>Brazil</strong></strong> captivates with its natural beauty, vibrant culture, and warm people. From Rio de Janeiro's iconic beaches to São Paulo's cosmopolitan energy, from Florianópolis's surf culture to the Amazon's wilderness, Brazil offers incredible diversity. The country launched a dedicated Digital Nomad Visa in 2022, making it easier than ever for remote workers to experience life in South America's largest nation. With costs 40-60% lower than the US or Western Europe, excellent weather year-round (depending on region), and one of the world's most welcoming cultures, Brazil has become a top destination for location-independent professionals.`,
