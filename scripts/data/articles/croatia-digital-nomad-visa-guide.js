  introduction: `<strong><strong>Croatia</strong></strong> was one of the first European countries to launch a dedicated Digital Nomad Visa in 2021, welcoming remote workers to its stunning Adriatic coastline, historic cities, and affordable Mediterranean lifestyle. From Dubrovnik's Game of Thrones fame to Split's Diocletian Palace, from Zagreb's Central European charm to the islands of Hvar and Korčula, Croatia offers beauty, safety, and value. The visa provides up to 1 year of residence with a notable tax benefit: no Croatian income tax on foreign-sourced earnings. Now an EU and Schengen member, Croatia combines accessibility with authentic Mediterranean culture.`,

    },

      answer: 'Shoulder seasons (April-May, September-October) are ideal—warm weather, fewer tourists, reasonable prices. Summer (June-August) is hot, crowded, and expensive. Winter is quiet on the coast (many businesses close) but Zagreb remains active.'

      question: 'How is the internet for remote work in Croatia?',
      answer: 'Good quality in cities—50-100+ Mbps available. Split and Zagreb have coworking spaces. Cafes are generally work-friendly. Smaller towns and islands may have slower connections. Mobile data (A1, T-Mobile, Tele2) is reliable backup.'
