  introduction: `<strong><strong>Spain</strong></strong> offers an irresistible combination: Mediterranean climate, rich culture, affordable living, and excellent quality of life. From Barcelona's architectural wonders to Madrid's vibrant energy, from Valencia's beaches to Seville's flamenco soul, Spain attracts expats seeking lifestyle over just career advancement. The 2023 launch of Spain's Digital Nomad Visa opened doors for remote workers, while existing routes serve entrepreneurs and employees. With costs significantly lower than Northern Europe, world-class food and wine, and some of Europe's best weather, Spain has become a top destination for those seeking work-life balance.`,
