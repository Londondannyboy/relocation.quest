    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to speak Spanish in Colombia?',

      answer: 'Medellín is called the "City of Eternal Spring" with temperatures of 70-80°F (21-27°C) year-round. No heating or air conditioning needed. There are wet and dry seasons but temperature remains consistent. Bogotá is cooler (50-65°F), while Cartagena is hot and tropical (80-90°F).'
