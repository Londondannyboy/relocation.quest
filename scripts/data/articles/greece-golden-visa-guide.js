  introduction: `<strong><strong>Greece</strong></strong>'s Golden Visa program remains one of Europe's most attractive residency-by-investment options, offering EU residence through property investment starting at €250,000 (in certain regions). While Portugal has restricted its property route and Spain has announced changes, Greece continues welcoming investors with relatively low thresholds and a straightforward process. The program grants 5-year renewable residence permits with minimal stay requirements, making it ideal for those seeking EU access without relocation obligations. Add Greece's Mediterranean lifestyle, rich history, and improving economy, and the Golden Visa becomes a compelling proposition.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is the minimum investment for Greece Golden Visa?',
      answer: 'It depends on location. €250,000 for non-prime areas (northern Greece, smaller islands, most of Peloponnese). €500,000 for Athens, Thessaloniki, Mykonos, Santorini, and other prime areas. The threshold increased in 2024 for popular regions.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to live in Greece with a Golden Visa?',
      answer: 'No. There is no minimum stay requirement. You only need to visit Greece once to apply and once every 5 years to renew. This makes it ideal for investors who want EU residence without relocating.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I work in Greece with a Golden Visa?',
      answer: 'You cannot work as an employee for a Greek company. However, you can conduct investment activities, be self-employed, or run your own business. Many Golden Visa holders work remotely for companies outside Greece.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I include my family in the Greece Golden Visa?',
      answer: 'Yes. Your spouse/partner, children under 21, and parents of both you and your spouse can be included under one investment. Each family member receives their own residence card.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I rent out my Golden Visa property?',
      answer: 'Yes. There are no restrictions on renting your property. Many investors use short-term rental platforms (Airbnb) in tourist areas to generate income from their Greek property.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I get Greek citizenship through the Golden Visa?',
      answer: 'Eventually, yes. After 7 years of legal residence, you can apply for Greek (EU) citizenship. However, citizenship requires actual residence in Greece, Greek language proficiency, and integration. The Golden Visa\'s no-stay requirement doesn\'t count toward citizenship.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Greece Golden Visa compare to Portugal?',
      answer: 'Portugal closed its property route in 2023, leaving only investment funds (€500,000). Greece still allows property investment at lower thresholds. Greece has no minimum stay; Portugal required 7 days/year. Greece cannot work as employee; Portugal allowed work. Greece is generally considered more straightforward now.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the total costs beyond property price?',
      answer: 'Expect approximately 8-10% additional costs: 3.09% transfer tax, 1-2% notary fees, 1-2% legal fees, 0.5-0.7% land registry fees, plus €2,000 residence permit fee. For a €250,000 property, budget around €275,000 total.'
