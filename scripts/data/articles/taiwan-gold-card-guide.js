  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is the Taiwan Employment Gold Card?',
      answer: 'The Taiwan Employment Gold Card is a 4-in-1 document combining work permit, resident visa, Alien Resident Certificate (ARC), and re-entry permit. Valid for 1-3 years and renewable, it allows holders to work for any employer, freelance, or start a business without needing sponsorship. Dependents can also be brought to Taiwan. It\'s designed to attract foreign talent to Taiwan.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I qualify for the Taiwan Gold Card as a digital nomad?',
      answer: 'For the Digital Field category, you need ONE of: monthly salary equivalent to NT$160,000+ ($5,000+) in current or previous position, demonstrated expertise with proof (awards, publications, patents), employment by a well-known tech company, or a PhD in a relevant field. Most digital nomads qualify through the salary requirement with employment contracts or pay stubs as evidence.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the tax benefits of the Taiwan Gold Card?',
      answer: 'For first-time Taiwan tax residents earning over NT$3 million/year ($100,000+), the first NT$3 million is taxed normally, but foreign-source income above that threshold may be exempt for the first 5 years. This makes Taiwan attractive for high earners with overseas clients. Consult a tax professional as rules are complex and individual circumstances vary.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does it cost to live in Taiwan?',
      answer: 'Taipei costs $1,800-3,000/month for comfortable living: rent NT$25,000-40,000 ($800-1,300) for a 1BR apartment, coworking NT$6,000-10,000 ($200-320), food NT$15,000-25,000 ($480-800). Other cities like Kaohsiung and Tainan are 30-40% cheaper. Budget living is possible at $1,000-1,400/month with studio apartment and local food.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does the Gold Card application take?',
      answer: 'Processing typically takes 30-60 days. Applications are submitted online through goldcard.nat.gov.tw. You may receive follow-up questions from the reviewing ministry. Some applications process faster (2-3 weeks), especially with strong documentation. It\'s recommended to apply with clear, comprehensive evidence to avoid delays.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I access Taiwan healthcare with the Gold Card?',
      answer: 'Yes, after 6 months of continuous residency, Gold Card holders can join Taiwan\'s National Health Insurance (NHI) system for approximately NT$1,500/month. NHI is world-class, covering nearly all medical needs with minimal copays. Before the 6-month mark, you\'ll need private insurance or pay out of pocket (still affordable compared to Western countries).'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to speak Chinese to live in Taiwan?',
      answer: 'You can survive in Taipei with English, especially in business settings and tourist areas. However, daily life is significantly easier with Mandarin—signage, restaurant menus, government offices, and conversations with locals. Outside Taipei, English proficiency drops. Learning basic Mandarin is highly recommended and makes the experience much richer.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I bring my family with the Gold Card?',
      answer: 'Yes, Gold Card holders can bring dependents including spouse and unmarried children under 20. Dependents receive Dependent Alien Resident Certificates (ARCs) tied to your Gold Card validity. Spouses can apply for open work permits. Children can attend local schools or international schools. Family members also qualify for NHI after the 6-month residency period.'
