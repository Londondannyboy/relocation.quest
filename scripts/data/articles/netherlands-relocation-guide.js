  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is the 30% ruling in the Netherlands?',
      answer: 'The 30% ruling is a tax benefit for skilled migrants recruited from abroad. It allows 30% of your gross salary to be paid tax-free for up to 5 years, significantly reducing your effective tax rate. You must be recruited from 150+ km outside Dutch borders, meet salary thresholds, and have expertise not readily available in the Netherlands. Apply within 4 months of starting work.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How difficult is it to find housing in the Netherlands?',
      answer: 'Very difficult—the Netherlands has a severe housing crisis, especially Amsterdam. Competition is fierce, prices are high, and you may need to offer above asking price or prepay rent. Use Funda, Pararius, and Facebook groups. Have documents ready, respond immediately to listings, and consider employer relocation assistance. Many start with temporary housing to search locally.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to speak Dutch to live in the Netherlands?',
      answer: 'Not necessarily—the Dutch have excellent English proficiency and many workplaces, especially in tech and international business, use English. You can function day-to-day in English in major cities. However, learning Dutch helps significantly with integration, making local friends, and shows commitment to staying. Free Dutch courses are available.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the cost of living in Amsterdam?',
      answer: 'Amsterdam is expensive. Budget living costs €2,300-3,000/month. Comfortable living runs €3,200-4,500/month including rent (€1,900-2,400 for 1BR), groceries (€350-500), dining (€350-600), and health insurance (€150-200). Other Dutch cities are 15-30% cheaper. The 30% ruling helps offset costs if you qualify.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the BSN number and how do I get it?',
      answer: 'The BSN (Burger Service Nummer) is the Dutch personal identification number, essential for employment, banking, healthcare, and most services. You get it by registering at your local municipality (gemeente) office. You need a Dutch address to register, creating a chicken-and-egg problem—temporary housing can help initially.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Dutch healthcare work?',
      answer: 'Dutch healthcare is high quality with mandatory basic insurance (€120-150/month). You must purchase from a private insurer. There\'s an annual deductible (eigen risico) of €385. The GP (huisarts) acts as gatekeeper to specialists. The Dutch approach is less intervention-focused than some countries—minor ailments may receive "wait and see" advice.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Amsterdam the best city for expats?',
      answer: 'Amsterdam is most international and has the most opportunities but is also most expensive and competitive. Rotterdam offers modern architecture and growing scenes at lower cost. The Hague suits those in government/international organizations and has beach access. Utrecht is charming and central. Eindhoven is the tech hub. Consider your industry and preferences.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Why are the Dutch so direct?',
      answer: 'Dutch directness is cultural—they value honesty and efficiency in communication. Feedback is given openly, opinions are shared directly, and there\'s little "softening" of messages. It\'s not rudeness but a different communication style. Many expats initially find it jarring but come to appreciate the clarity. Don\'t take direct feedback personally.'
