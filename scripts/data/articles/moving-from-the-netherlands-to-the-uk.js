  introduction: `While many Europeans moved to the Netherlands post-Brexit, some Dutch residents—whether Dutch nationals or expats—are considering the reverse journey to the UK. London remains one of the world's premier cities for finance, tech, and creative industries, and the UK offers opportunities not found elsewhere. However, Brexit has fundamentally changed the rules: EU citizens, including Dutch nationals, now need visas for anything beyond short visits. This guide covers everything you need to know about making the move from the Netherlands to the UK in 2026.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'Do Dutch citizens need a visa to work in the UK after Brexit?',
      answer: 'Yes. Since January 1, 2021, Dutch citizens (and all EU citizens) need a visa to live and work in the UK beyond 6 months visitor status. The main route is the Skilled Worker Visa, which requires employer sponsorship and minimum £38,700 salary.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How much does a UK work visa cost for Dutch citizens?',
      answer: 'The Skilled Worker Visa costs £719-1,500 depending on duration, plus the Immigration Health Surcharge of £1,035 per year of your stay (paid upfront). For a 3-year visa, budget approximately £4,500-5,000 total in government fees alone.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is London more expensive than Amsterdam?',
      answer: 'Yes, significantly. London rent is approximately 25-35% higher than Amsterdam for equivalent properties. However, UK regional cities like Manchester or Birmingham can be comparable or even cheaper than Amsterdam while offering good career opportunities.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How does UK healthcare compare to the Dutch system?',
      answer: 'The NHS is free at point of use (after paying the Immigration Health Surcharge with your visa), with no monthly premiums or deductibles like the Dutch system. Quality is good but wait times for specialists can be longer than in the Netherlands.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I keep my Dutch pension (AOW) if I move to the UK?',
      answer: 'Your AOW entitlement depends on years lived/worked in the Netherlands (2% per year). Moving to the UK does not forfeit accumulated rights, but you stop accruing further entitlement. UK has a bilateral agreement ensuring pension rights. Consult SVB for specific situation.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is it hard to find housing in London?',
      answer: 'Yes, the London rental market is very competitive. Properties can be let within hours. You typically need employer reference, previous landlord reference, and may need a UK-based guarantor if you lack UK credit history. Start searching early and be ready to act fast.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How is the UK tax system different from the Netherlands?',
      answer: 'UK has no wealth tax (unlike Dutch Box 3), which can be advantageous for those with investments. Income tax rates are similar at lower levels but UK top rates kick in later. The UK tax year runs April-April, not calendar year. Consult a tax advisor familiar with both systems.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long until I can get UK permanent residence (ILR)?',
      answer: 'With a Skilled Worker Visa, you can apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) after 5 years of continuous residence. You must pass the Life in the UK test and meet English language requirements. ILR leads to the option of British citizenship after one further year.'
