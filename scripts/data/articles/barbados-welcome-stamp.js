  introduction: `<strong><strong>Barbados</strong></strong> pioneered the Caribbean digital nomad movement when it launched the Welcome Stamp in July 2020, inviting remote workers to "live and work in paradise." This small but sophisticated island nation offers the quintessential Caribbean experience—turquoise waters, white-sand beaches, warm hospitality—combined with first-world infrastructure and British-influenced stability. Located in the eastern Caribbean, Barbados provides reliable internet, quality healthcare, vibrant culture, and a well-established expat community. While not the cheapest Caribbean option, Barbados delivers a premium tropical lifestyle that has attracted thousands of digital nomads seeking year-round sunshine, rum punch sunsets, and the legendary Bajan warmth.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What are the requirements for the Barbados Welcome Stamp?',
      answer: 'The Welcome Stamp requires: minimum $50,000/year income, employment with company outside Barbados or self-employed with foreign clients, valid health insurance, clean criminal record, and $2,000 application fee ($3,000 for families). You must prove income with tax returns, pay stubs, or contracts. Processing takes approximately 2-4 weeks.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How expensive is Barbados for digital nomads?',
      answer: 'Barbados is mid-range for Caribbean digital nomad destinations. Budget living costs $2,000-3,200/month. Comfortable living runs $3,700-5,500/month including apartment ($1,800-2,500), food ($850-1,300), transport ($250-400), and entertainment. South coast is more affordable than west coast. Not cheap but good value for Caribbean quality.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I pay taxes in Barbados with the Welcome Stamp?',
      answer: 'No—foreign income earned while on the Welcome Stamp is not taxed in Barbados. You\'re prohibited from working for Barbadian companies, so your foreign earnings remain tax-free locally. However, US citizens still owe US tax on worldwide income. Other nationalities should check their home country\'s tax residency rules.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which area of Barbados is best for digital nomads?',
      answer: 'South coast (Hastings, Rockley, St. Lawrence Gap) offers the best balance of affordability, amenities, and social scene. West coast is more upscale and expensive but has calmer beaches. East coast is dramatic but rough for swimming. Bridgetown area is central but less beachy. Most nomads choose south coast for value and convenience.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How is the internet in Barbados?',
      answer: 'Internet is decent but not exceptional—20-100 Mbps available through Flow and Digicel. Home internet costs $80-150/month. Reliability is generally good with occasional outages. Mobile 4G coverage is good island-wide. For serious bandwidth needs, test before committing to accommodation. Coworking spaces typically have reliable connections.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the weather like in Barbados?',
      answer: 'Barbados has tropical weather year-round: 25-30°C (77-86°F). Dry season (December-May) is ideal with less rain. Rainy season (June-November) brings brief afternoon showers but rarely all-day rain. Barbados is southeast of the main hurricane belt, making it safer than many Caribbean islands, though awareness is still important during season.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need a car in Barbados?',
      answer: 'Highly recommended. While buses and ZR minibuses exist, they\'re slow and don\'t cover everywhere. Having a car ($400-700/month rental) allows you to explore all beaches and the island freely. Note that Barbados drives on the left (British style). Taxis are available but expensive for regular use.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How big is the digital nomad community in Barbados?',
      answer: 'Barbados has an active and growing digital nomad community thanks to being a Welcome Stamp pioneer. There are regular meetups, active Facebook groups, and networking events. The community is smaller than places like Bali or Lisbon but more tight-knit. The long-established expat community adds to the social scene.'
