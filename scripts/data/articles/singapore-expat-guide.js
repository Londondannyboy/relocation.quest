  introduction: `<strong><strong>Singapore</strong></strong> stands as Asia's premier destination for expats seeking world-class infrastructure, safety, and business opportunities. This city-state of 5.5 million has transformed from a trading post to a global financial hub in just decades. English is an official language, rule of law is paramount, corruption is virtually nonexistent, and efficiency defines daily life. From hawker centers serving $3 meals to Michelin-starred restaurants, from Marina Bay's futuristic skyline to preserved shophouse neighborhoods, Singapore offers a unique blend of East and West. While expensive, Singapore rewards with exceptional quality of life, career opportunities, and a strategic base for exploring Asia.`,
