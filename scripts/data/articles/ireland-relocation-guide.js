  introduction: `<strong><strong>Ireland</strong></strong> has transformed from an emigration nation to one of Europe's most attractive destinations for international talent. Home to European headquarters of Google, Meta, Apple, and countless tech giants, Dublin has become a major tech hub rivaling London and Amsterdam. Beyond technology, Ireland offers stunning natural landscapes, rich cultural heritage, English-speaking environment, and famously welcoming people. The Critical Skills Employment Permit provides a fast track to residency for skilled workers. While Dublin's housing crisis and cost of living present challenges, Ireland's combination of opportunity, culture, and quality of life continues to draw professionals from around the world.`,

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is the Critical Skills Employment Permit?',
      answer: 'The Critical Skills Employment Permit is Ireland\'s premium work visa for in-demand occupations. It requires: occupation on the Critical Skills list (tech, healthcare, engineering, finance) with €38,000+ salary, or any job with €64,000+ salary. Benefits include no labor market test, immediate family reunification, and path to Stamp 4 residency after 2 years. It\'s the fastest route to permanent residency.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How expensive is Dublin compared to other cities?',
      answer: 'Dublin is expensive—among Europe\'s priciest capitals. Comfortable living costs €3,500-4,900/month, with rent alone €2,100-2,600 for a 1BR. Cork and Galway are 20-30% cheaper. Dublin\'s high tech salaries offset costs somewhat. Housing is the main challenge with severe shortage and fierce competition.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Dublin a good place for tech jobs?',
      answer: 'Excellent—Dublin is a major European tech hub. Google, Meta (Facebook), Apple, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Amazon, and many others have European headquarters there. The tech ecosystem is vibrant with startups and established companies. Salaries are competitive, and the English-speaking environment makes it accessible for international talent.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How difficult is it to find housing in Ireland?',
      answer: 'Very difficult, especially in Dublin. Ireland has a housing crisis with demand far exceeding supply. Viewings can have dozens of applicants, and rents are high. Use Daft.ie, respond immediately to listings, have documents ready, and consider starting with temporary accommodation to search locally. Many employers help with initial housing.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is a PPS number and how do I get it?',
      answer: 'The PPS (Personal Public Service) number is Ireland\'s essential ID number, needed for employment, tax, healthcare, and banking. Apply at your local social welfare/Intreo office with proof of identity and address. Getting a PPS number can be challenging without an address, creating a chicken-and-egg situation—some use employer addresses initially.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is Irish work culture like?',
      answer: 'Irish work culture is generally relaxed and relationship-oriented. Building rapport matters—small talk and humor are valued. Pub culture extends to work socializing, with after-work drinks common. Tech multinationals often have American-influenced culture. Work-life balance is respected, with minimum 20 days annual leave.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I consider Cork or Galway instead of Dublin?',
      answer: 'Yes, worth considering. Cork has Apple, Dell, Pfizer and a strong tech/pharma scene at 20-30% lower costs. Galway offers medtech industry, vibrant arts scene, and gateway to stunning west coast. Both have better quality of life metrics and easier housing markets. If your job allows or you find opportunity there, they\'re excellent alternatives.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Ireland still in the EU after Brexit?',
      answer: 'Yes—Ireland remains a full EU member. In fact, Ireland is now the only English-speaking country in the EU, which has increased its attractiveness for companies and workers. The UK\'s departure has brought financial services jobs and made Ireland an even more strategic EU gateway for English-speaking markets.'
