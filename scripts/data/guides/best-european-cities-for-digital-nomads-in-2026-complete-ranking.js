      question: 'Which European city is cheapest for digital nomads?',
      answer: 'Tbilisi, Georgia offers the lowest cost of living at around €800-1,000/month for comfortable living. Within the EU, Sofia, Bulgaria and Bucharest, Romania offer excellent value at €1,000-1,200/month. These cities provide modern amenities, fast internet, and growing nomad communities at a fraction of Western European costs.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need a digital nomad visa for Europe?',
      answer: 'It depends on your nationality and intended stay length. Many nationalities can stay in the Schengen Area for 90 days within any 180-day period without a visa. For longer stays, you will need either a digital nomad visa (available in Portugal, Spain, Croatia, Estonia, Greece, and others) or another type of residence permit. Some countries like Georgia and Serbia offer longer visa-free periods.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which European country has the best digital nomad visa?',
      answer: 'Portugal and Spain currently offer the most attractive digital nomad visas. Portugal allows 2-year stays with path to residency, has a large nomad community, and offers the NHR tax regime. Spain launched its 2024 program with 3-year stays and streamlined processing. Estonia pioneered the concept and remains excellent for tech workers.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What internet speeds can I expect in Europe?',
      answer: 'Europe generally offers excellent internet infrastructure. Average speeds range from 50-200 Mbps in major cities. Romania and the Baltics consistently rank among the fastest globally. Most coworking spaces offer 100+ Mbps. Mobile 4G/5G coverage is widespread, making backup connectivity easy.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Lisbon still worth it despite rising costs?',
      answer: 'Lisbon remains worthwhile for its unmatched combination of climate (300+ sunny days), established nomad infrastructure, English proficiency, safety, and lifestyle. However, accommodation costs have doubled since 2019. Consider alternatives like Porto, Valencia, or Málaga if budget is a primary concern.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which city has the largest digital nomad community?',
      answer: 'Lisbon has the largest established community with thousands of active nomads, numerous coworking spaces, and regular meetups. Barcelona, Berlin, and Budapest also have thriving communities. Emerging hubs like Split, Athens, and Tbilisi are growing rapidly and offer easier integration due to smaller, closer-knit communities.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I open a bank account as a digital nomad in Europe?',
      answer: 'Traditional banking can be challenging without residency. However, digital banks like Wise, N26, Revolut, and Monzo operate throughout Europe and are ideal for nomads. Some countries like Portugal and Estonia make it easier to open accounts with their nomad visa programs. Estonia e-Residency allows opening EU business banking remotely.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What about healthcare as a digital nomad in Europe?',
      answer: 'You will need private health insurance for most nomad visas. SafetyWing, World Nomads, and Cigna Global are popular options starting around €50-150/month. European healthcare is generally excellent and affordable even privately. Some countries allow access to public healthcare after establishing residency.'
