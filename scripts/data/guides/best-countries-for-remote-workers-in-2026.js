  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'What is the cheapest country for remote workers?',
      answer: 'Georgia offers the best value with visa-free stays up to 1 year, extremely low costs (€800-1,200/month comfortable living in Tbilisi), good internet, and a welcoming nomad community. Other ultra-affordable options include Vietnam, Albania, and parts of Mexico.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Which country has the best digital nomad visa?',
      answer: 'Portugal consistently ranks highest for its combination of accessibility (€3,040/month income, 2-year term), quality of life, tax benefits (NHR regime), and established nomad community. Spain, Croatia, and Greece also offer excellent programs.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I have to pay taxes as a digital nomad?',
      answer: 'Tax obligations depend on your citizenship, where you spend time, and where your income is sourced. US citizens are taxed on worldwide income. Others typically owe taxes where they are "tax resident" (usually 183+ days). Some countries like Georgia, UAE, and Panama have no personal income tax. Always consult a tax professional.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What internet speed do I need to work remotely?',
      answer: 'For most remote work (video calls, cloud applications, basic tasks), 25-50 Mbps is sufficient. For heavy video work, streaming, or development with large file transfers, 100+ Mbps is preferable. Most countries in our top 30 offer 50+ Mbps in urban areas.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I work remotely without a digital nomad visa?',
      answer: 'Many people work remotely on tourist visas, though this exists in a legal gray area in most countries. Tourist visas technically prohibit "work." For short stays with non-local clients, enforcement is rare. For long-term stays, a proper visa provides legal security and often additional benefits like banking access.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What about healthcare as a remote worker abroad?',
      answer: 'Most digital nomad visas require health insurance. Options include: travel insurance (SafetyWing, World Nomads), international health insurance (Cigna Global, Allianz), or local insurance in your destination country. Research healthcare quality in your destination—it varies widely.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is it lonely being a digital nomad?',
      answer: 'It can be if you are not proactive. However, popular nomad destinations have vibrant communities. Coworking spaces, Nomad List meetups, Slack communities, and social apps help connect people. Many nomads report richer social lives than working in traditional offices.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I handle time zones with my team?',
      answer: 'Choose destinations with reasonable overlap with your team. Europe works well for UK/US East Coast teams. Southeast Asia suits Australia/Asia teams. Latin America fits Americas. Many nomads maintain 4-6 hours of overlap and use async communication for the rest.'
