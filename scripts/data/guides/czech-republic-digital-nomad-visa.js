  executive_summary: `Prague has emerged as one of Europe's most beloved destinations for digital nomads, offering a captivating blend of medieval architecture, vibrant culture, excellent beer (the world's best!), and remarkably affordable living. While the Czech Republic doesn't have a dedicated "digital nomad visa," the Zivnostensky list (freelancer trade license, commonly called "Zivno") provides a legitimate pathway for remote workers to establish legal residency. Combined with a cost of living roughly 50% of Western Europe and one of the continent's best quality-of-life-to-cost ratios, Prague has become a digital nomad hub rivaling Lisbon and Barcelona.`,

      title: 'Why Digital Nomads Love Prague',
      content: `Prague consistently ranks among the best cities for digital nomads, and for good reason. The city offers an intoxicating mix of Gothic spires, baroque palaces, and communist-era brutalism, all within a walkable city center. The cost of living is remarkably low—a quality meal costs €8-12, a beer €2-3, and a comfortable apartment €800-1,200/month. Internet speeds are excellent (100+ Mbps typical), and English is widely spoken in the international community. The central European location makes weekend trips to Vienna, Berlin, Munich, or Krakow easy and cheap.`

      title: 'Understanding the Zivno (Trade License)',
      content: `The Zivnostensky list is not technically a visa but a freelancer trade license that allows self-employed work in the Czech Republic. Once you have a Zivno, you can apply for a long-term residence permit based on self-employment. This two-step process provides legal status for digital nomads working for clients outside the Czech Republic. The system was designed for traditional freelancers but works well for remote workers. You register a "trade" (činnost) related to your work—common choices include "Software development," "Consulting activities," or "Marketing services."`

      content: `Prague is divided into numbered districts radiating from the center. Prague 1 (Old Town, Lesser Town) is historic but touristy and expensive. Prague 2 (Vinohrady, Nové Město) is the expat favorite—beautiful architecture, great restaurants, reasonable rents. Prague 3 (Žižkov) is hip and affordable with great nightlife. Prague 7 (Holešovice) has a creative vibe with galleries and industrial-chic coworking spaces. Rent ranges from €700-900 in outer areas to €1,000-1,400 centrally for a 1BR apartment.`

      title: 'Beyond Prague',
      content: `While Prague dominates the nomad scene, other Czech cities offer alternatives. Brno, the second city, has a strong university atmosphere, lower costs, and an emerging tech scene. Český Krumlov is a UNESCO fairy-tale town for those seeking small-town charm. Ostrava offers industrial heritage and easy access to the mountains. Plzeň (Pilsen) is the birthplace of pilsner beer and surprisingly livable. All have good internet and lower costs than Prague.`

  faqs: [
    {
      question: 'Does Czech Republic have a digital nomad visa?',
      answer: 'Not specifically. However, the Zivnostensky list (trade license) combined with a Long-Term Residence Permit for business purposes provides legal status for self-employed remote workers. This is the de facto "digital nomad" route used by thousands of nomads in Prague.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the cost of living in Prague?',
      answer: 'Prague is remarkably affordable. Budget €1,400-1,800/month for comfortable living: rent €800-1,000, food €300-400, transport €20, entertainment €200-300. This is roughly 50% of Western European capitals like Paris or Amsterdam.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How long does the Zivno process take?',
      answer: 'The trade license itself can be issued same-day. However, the Long-Term Residence Permit takes 60-90 days (often longer). Total process from start to having residence permit is typically 3-5 months.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to speak Czech?',
      answer: 'In Prague, no. English is widely spoken, especially in international areas and tech communities. Government offices may require Czech or a translator. In smaller cities, Czech is more necessary. Learning basics is appreciated.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What trade category should I register?',
      answer: 'For most digital nomads: "Činnost v oblasti informačních technologií" (IT activities) or "Poradenská a konzultační činnost" (consulting) require no qualifications. Marketing, design, and writing also have straightforward categories. Choose one that broadly covers your work.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I stay in Czech Republic while my permit is being processed?',
      answer: 'Generally no—you cannot wait in the Czech Republic on a tourist stay while your residence permit is processed. You typically must apply from outside the country and wait for approval before returning. Some exceptions exist for certain nationalities.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What are the tax implications of Zivno?',
      answer: 'As a Zivno holder, you are self-employed in Czech Republic and may be subject to Czech taxes if you become tax resident (183+ days). However, a flat-expense deduction of 60-80% of income (depending on trade) simplifies taxes. Effective rates can be favorable. Consult a Czech accountant.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Prague good for families with children?',
      answer: 'Yes. Prague is very safe, has good international schools (though expensive), excellent public transport, and many parks. The expat community includes many families. Healthcare is good and affordable. Cost of living makes single-income families more viable than in Western Europe.'
